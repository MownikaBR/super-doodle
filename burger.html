                <p class="indianburger">Aloo tikki, also known as aloo ki tikkia,
                     aloo ki tikki or alu tikki, is a snack originating from the Indian subcontinent.
                      in Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi preparation, it is made of boiled potatoes, peas, and various curry spices. Aloo means potato
                       in Hindi-Urdu and Marathi, and tikki means a small cutlet or croquette. The dish is served hot along with a side of saunth, tamarind, and coriander-mint sauce,
                        and sometimes dahi (yogurt) or chickpeas.

            <p class="indianburger">Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a main course,
                 often served with naan flatbread. It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries,
                  such as butter chicken. Local varieties of tandoori chicken prepared from the rooyi posto in 
                  Bengal have appeared in local eateries, particularly those between Kolaghat and Kolkata. Tandoori 
                  chicken was popularized in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi
                   when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.
                There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.

        <p class="indianburger">Their first grilled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry ever. 
            It was reformulated as the Chicken Whopper (1992), named after their Whopper Sandwich.
            it was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. The sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards
             the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads.

        <p class="indianburger">The Crispy Veg Burger at Burger King is the perfect combination of soft sesame buns,
             a masaledar crispy veg patty, topped with a delicious, tangy sauce, and garnished with onions.
             When the beans are processed for burgers, that moisture can cause your beans to turn to mush. To prevent this from happening, 
             take the extra step to dry out the beans in the oven.
